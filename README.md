# Bank_Account
This program simulates basic bank account operations, allowing you to deposit money, withdraw funds, and check your balance. You can perform a deposit to add money to your account, and the balance will be updated accordingly. The withdrawal operation lets you withdraw money from your account, with the balance decreasing if sufficient funds are available. The enquiry operation allows you to check the current balance at any time, giving you an accurate view of the funds in your account. This program provides a simple way to manage and track your bank account transactions.
